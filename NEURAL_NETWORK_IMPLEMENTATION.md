# Neural Network Pre-Training Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement a separate neural network training process for the Emotion-Based Video Recommendation system.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Separated Training from the Streamlit App

- Created `train_neural_model.py` as a standalone script for model training
- Added `Train_Model.bat` for easy launching of the training process
- Removed training functionality from the app.py file
- Updated the admin panel to direct users to the training script

### 2. Focused nn_recommender.py on Inference Only

- Removed training code from nn_recommender.py
- Streamlined the file to focus on loading and using pre-trained models
- Added improved error handling and logging
- Ensured backwards compatibility with the rest of the system

### 3. Enhanced the User Experience

- Added clear instructions in the admin panel about the training process
- Updated the recommendation engine to display when neural recommendations are used
- Created model training progress visualization (saved to PNG file)
- Added documentation for users and developers

### 4. Improved Visualization and Logging

- Added training history plots that are saved to the filesystem
- Improved logging in the training script
- Added visual feedback in the app when neural network recommendations are used

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: The Streamlit app remains responsive since it no longer handles computation-intensive training
2. **Better Model Quality**: The standalone script can perform more thorough training
3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable
4. **Better User Experience**: Users get clear instructions about the training process and visual feedback

## Usage Notes

### For Users

1. First run the application normally to collect some interaction data
2. Once sufficient data is available (at least 10 video interactions), run `Train_Model.bat`
3. Restart the application to use the trained model for recommendations

### For Developers

1. The neural network architecture is defined in `train_neural_model.py`
2. Model loading and inference is handled in `nn_recommender.py`
3. The recommendation engine uses the neural predictions when available, with fallback to traditional mapping

## Next Steps

1. Further enhance the neural network architecture with more advanced features
2. Add an option to auto-train the model when sufficient data is available
3. Implement data preprocessing options in the training script for better performance
4. Explore options for YOLO integration for video content analysis
